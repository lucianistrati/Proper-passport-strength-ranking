Passport power related ones
nominal
PPP



This repository contains several ways in which a passport strength ranking looks like when adjusted not only for the number of countries that you are allowed to visit VISA-free with your passport, but also how those countries are doing in terms of:

- HDI (Human Development Index)
- GDP per capita nominal & PPP (gross domestic product in nominal and parity purchasing power terms)
- Tourism
- Safety
- Opportunities in life
- Wealth per capita
- Minimum and average salaries
- Some other metrics + a compounded score of the above ones

The purpose of this research is to highlight how much of the life opportunities of work and travel of someone can actually become severely limited by the passport that you have from the country in which you were born.

Most passport strength rankings are currently looking just at the number of countries to which you have access with your passport, but this is severely underestimating the real problem which is it does not matter if you can visit more countries VISA free or you can move to more countries and obtain working permits there if those countries are not desirable in any regard, what it matters at the end of the day is the actual quality of life that you can find in those countries that you visit or where you might seek work opportunities.

And let's be real, if you are a westerne, there is a ton of countries where indeed we might have VISA free access there, but we might never go there because we have some concerns when it comes to being in those countries (which can range on a wide scale from poverty to riskiness and from safety to cleanliness). What this study aims to then show is that there are people who by their God-given birth they have the right or the opportunity to travel easily and without hassles just in these countries where many of us would never pick for travel, let alone work.

Ultimately, if you look at a classical passport ranking website such as https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php you might see that with a Dutch passport you can visit 177 countries easily (133 VISA free entirely and 44 with VISA on arrival) while with an Afghani passport you can visit 40 countries easily (7 VISA free and 33 with VISA on arrival). This fact, as unreasonable as it seems might still be reasoned as "alright, so with a Dutch passport you have an easy access to roughly 4.5 times more countries than with an Afghani passport", but this quantitative reasoning makes less sense than the common sense reasoning which should be "with a Dutch passport you can get to pretty much anywhere, it does not matter if you wish to go there at all or not, while with an Afghani passport you can go to mostly countries where a westerner would never even think of going because of the shear amount of concerns that they have about those countries". So if 4.5x more countries sounded awful already, going anywhere you want versus going to where you would barely want to go is even worse in reality.
